Generating Random numbers using calendar class in Java

Usually Random numbers are the numbers that use a large set of numbers and selects a number using the mathematical algorithm. It satisfies the following two conditions:
-   The generated values uniformly distributed over a definite interval.
-   It is impossible to guess the future value based on current and past values

Here I am going to show a new way to generate it without using old functions i.e by using calendar class of util package

Example :
If  Year    =  2022
    Date    =  04
    Minute  =  09
    Second  =  11

Output = 800712
